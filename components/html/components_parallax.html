													<h1>The Day My Mother Forgot to Cry</h1>
													<p>I shudder to recall that dreadful Diwali night of October 2007, when my mother knocked our
														bed room at the dead
														of the night enquiring where the toilet was. She looked disoriented and totally confused.
														Unable to understand
														the cause for her abnormal behaviour, we thought she was still in a semi-sleep state and
														showed her the toilet.
														But even after coming out of toilet she was unable to find her way to her bed room.</p>
												</div>
											</div>
											<div class="parallax-section">
												<div class="p fixed">Sensing that something is seriously amiss, we took her next day to the
													nearby nursing home for
													diagnosis and treatment. She was immediately referred to a neurosurgeon and after a MRI scan
													it was confirmed that
													she suffered a brain stroke. The report showed certain grey patches which the doctor referred
													to as clots have
													affected her memory totally. The doctor informed that the memory loss is irreversible due to
													her old age. He,
													however, assured that further, damage to the brain can be arrested with drugs.</div>
											</div>
											<div class="parallax-section">
												<div class="p fixed">That was the beginning of the slow end for my mother. As the disease got
													worsened, she forgot
													everything. Lost control of her body functions and finally, failed to recognize anyone except
													my wife who used to
													take care of her like a mother taking care of her baby. She used to feed her, change her
													diapers, dress her, give
													her bath, brush her hair, and also help her to sleep.</div>
											</div>
											<div class="parallax-section">
												<div class="p fixed">For my wife and me, she was like a little child. Our world revolved around
													her. We used to play
													with her, tease her. We even celebrated her 80th birth day with a grand cake cutting ceremony
													attended by my
													wife’s friends in Kolkata. It was a moment of happiness for her as she kept smiling at every
													one greeting her on
													her birth day without knowing whose birth day it was. So when one of the guests greeted her
													with a “wish you a
													happy birth day”, she promptly responded by wishing her the same!</div>
											</div>
											<div class="parallax-section">
												<div class="p fixed">It was interesting to know that even after destroying her brain cells; the
													disease could not
													take away the basic courtesies from her, acquired during her training as a Telephone Operator
													long long ago. They
													remained entrenched in her till her last breath. She never forgot to express her sincere
													thanks whenever we help
													her with little things.</div>
											</div>
											<div class="parallax-section">
												<div class="p fixed">The thud sound of a body hitting the ground rudely awakened us. We looked
													around to find my
													mother missing from her bed. In a swift motion my wife jumped from the bed and dashed out of
													the room to find her
													lay flat, face down on the floor motion less. Her fore head was badly injured. She was
													bleeding profusely from her
													lips due to the impact of the fall. But there was virtually no reaction from her. We
													physically lifted her and put
													her on the bed. My wife gently cleansed the wound and enquired whether it was hurting. She
													replied in affirmative.
													But there was no sign of pain in the face. No tears in her eyes. Just plain disoriented look,
													devoid of any
													feelings and emotions. The disease took away all her emotional feelings and also dried up the
													tear glands. Looking
													at her state I cried silently.</div>
											</div>
											<div class="parallax-section">
												<div class="p fixed">Oh God! I said to myself. Is this is my mother, who used to get tears in
													her eyes even for a
													faint discomfort? She was emotionally so sensitive that even a stern look, would bring her to
													tears. Such was her
													reputation for crying that my father used to tease her by calling her “Gangadhari”. Lady
													wearing river Ganges on
													her head.</div>
											</div>
											<div class="parallax-section">
												<div class="p fixed">The day she passed away and as her body was being carried in a “Hearse” van
													there were
													unexpected showers for few minutes as if the heavens have cried for her, as she forgot to cry.
